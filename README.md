My Personal Big Sur 11.2.3 EFI for Lenovo Legion Y520

This is my personal OpenCore EFI for my current hackintosh (dual-boot macOS Big Sur 11.2.3 and Windows 10). If you want a tutorial how to use it in your system or you have any questions please open an issue :)

Working:
- iGPU
- Intel Wifi
- Bluetooth (tested only Apple devices, other should work too)
- Audio
- Camera
- Keyboard & touchpad
- Brightness control
- FileVault

Can work, help wanted:
- [USB-C video](https://github.com/adrianjagielak/lenovo_y520_efi/issues/6)

Not working:

- HDMI/DisplayPort video (connected to dGPU)
